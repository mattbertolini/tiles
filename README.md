# Fork of Apache Tiles

This is a fork of Apache Tiles. It does the following:

* Combines the tiles, tiles-request, and tiles-autotag repos into one for easier management.
* Adds a copy of the last working spring tiles support as a dedicated module.
* Upgrades to Jakarta EE
* Removes portlet support
* Removes velocity support (doesn't support Jakarta EE)
* Updates the build to use the latest version of Maven via a wrapper
* Updates to Java 17
* Updates to Junit 5
* Updating dependencies to latest versions

This is not for production use.
